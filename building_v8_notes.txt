Building v8.lib on Windows 10

1. install vc2017 community edition. Ensure that it works (build a solution).
2. open vc2017x64 command prompt 
3. create a directory called src (Mine is c:\src)
4. download depot_tools.zip
5. EXTRACT depot_tools.zip inside src directory (Yes extract not copy!)
6. set some environment varibles 
    set path=c:\src\depot_tools;%PATH%
    set GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2015
    set DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN=0
    set GYP_GENERATORS=msvs
7. gclient sync
8. cd v8; fetch v8
9. C:\src\depot_tools\v8>..\python276_bin\python.exe gypfiles\gyp_v8 -Dtarget_arch=x64
10. a few warnings are produced. Solution file should be produced. (gypfiles\all.sln)
11. open the solution file (gypfiles\all.sln) on visual studio and build it.
